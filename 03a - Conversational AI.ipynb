    "# Conversational AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how often you communicate with other people through instant messaging, social media, email, or other online technologies. For many of us, it's our go-to form of contact. When you have a question at work, you might reach out to a colleague using a chat message, which you can use on mobile devices, so you're always in touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bots are AI agents that communicate using these kinds of channels, enabling a natural, conversational engagement with software services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:center'><img src='./images/conversational_ai.jpg' alt='A human and a robot having a conversation'/></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1950, Alan Turing devised the *Imitation Game*, which has become known as the *Turing Test* and hypothesizes that if a dialog is natural enough, you may not know whether you're conversing with a human or a computer. As AI grows ever more sophisticated, this kind of conversational interaction with applications and digital assistants is becoming more and more common, and in specific scenarios can result in human-like interactions with bots. Common scenarios for this kind of solution include customer support agents, reservation systems, and home automation among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a QnA Maker Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "For customer support scenarios, it's common to create a bot that can interpret and answer frequently asked questions through a website chat window, email, or voice interface. Underlying the bot interface is a knowledge base of questions and appropriate answers that the bot can search for suitable responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QnA Maker service is a cognitive service in Azure that enables you to quickly create a knowledge base, either by entering question and answer pairs or from an existing document or web page. It can then use some built-in natural language processing capabilities to interpret questions and find appropriate answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open another browser tab and go to the QnA Maker portal at <a href='https://qnamaker.ai' target='_blank'>https://qnamaker.ai</a>. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.\n",
    "2. In the QnA Maker portal, select **Create a knowledge base**.\n",
    "3. If you haven't previously created a QnA service resource, select **Create a QnA service**. The Azure portal will be opened in another tab so you can create a QnA Maker service in your subscription. Use the following settings:\n",
    "  - **Name**: *A unique name for your QnA resource*\n",
    "  - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*\n",
    "  - **Pricing tier**: F0\n",
    "  - **Resource group**: *Select an existing resource group or create a new one*\n",
    "  - **Azure Search pricing tier**: B\n",
    "  - **Azure Search location**: *Any available location*\n",
    "  - **App name**: _Same as **Name** (\".azurewebsites.net\" will be appended automatically)_\n",
    "  - **Website location**: _Same as **Azure Search location**_\n",
    "  - **App insights**: Disable\n",
    "4. When the deployment of the QnA Service and related resources is complete in the Azure portal, return to the QnA Maker portal tab, and in the **Step 2** section, click **Refresh** to refresh the list of available QnA service resources.\n",
    "5. Connect your QnA service to your KB by selecting the following options:\n",
    "  - **Microsoft Azure Directory ID**: *The Azure directory ID for your subscription*\n",
    "  - **Azure subscription name**: *Your Azure subscription*\n",
    "  - **Azure QnA service**: *The QnA service resource you created in the previous step*\n",
    "  - **Language**: English\n",
    "6. In the **Step 3** section, enter the name **Adventure Works KB**.\n",
    "7. In the **Step 4** section, in the **URL** box, type `https://github.com/GraemeMalcolm/ai-fundamentals/raw/master/data/AdventureWorks_FAQ.docx` and click **+ Add URL**. Then under **Chit-chat**, select **Professional**.\n",
    "8. In the **Step 5** section, click **Create your KB**.\n",
    "9. Wait for a minute or so while your Knowledge base is created. Then review the questions and answers that have been imported from the FAQ document and the professional chit-chat pre-defined responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edit the Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "Your knowledge base is based on the details in the FAQ document and some pre-defined responses. You can add custom question-and-answer pairs to supplement these.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **+ Add QnA pair**.\n",
    "2. In the **Question** box, type `Hello`. Then click **+ Add alternative phrasing** and type `Hi`.\n",
    "3. In the **Answer** box, type `Hello`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train and Test the Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a knowledge base, you can test it in the QnA Maker portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top right of the page, click **Save and train** to train your knowledge base.\n",
    "2. After training has completed, click **&larr; Test** to open the test pane.\n",
    "3. In the test pane, at the bottom enter the message `Hi`. The response **Hello** should be returned.\n",
    "4. In the test pane, at the bottom enter the message `I want to reserve a cycle`. An appropriate response from the FAQ should be returned.\n",
    "5. When you're done testing the knowledge base, click **&rarr; Test** to close the test pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Bot for the Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge base provides a back-end service that client applications can use to answer questions through some sort of user interface. Commonly, these client applications are bots. To make the knowledge base available to a bot, you must publish it as a service that can be accessed over HTTP. You can then use the Microsoft Bot Framework to create and host a bot that uses the knowledge base to answer user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of the QnA Make page, click **Publish**. Then in the **Adventure Works KB** page, click **Publish**.\n",
    "2. After the service has been deployed, click **Create Bot**. This opens the Azure portal in a new browser tab so you can create a Web App Bot in your Azure subscription.\n",
    "3. In the Azure portal, create a Web App Bot with the following settings (most of these will be pre-populated for you):\n",
    "  - **Bot handle**: *A unique name for your bot*\n",
    "  - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*\n",
    "  - **Resource group**: *The resource group containing your QnA Maker resource*\n",
    "  - **Location**: *The same location as your QnA Maker service*.\n",
    "  - **Pricing tier**: F0\n",
    "  - **App name**: *Same as the **Bot handle** with *.azurewebsites.net* appended automatically\n",
    "  - **SDK language**: *Choose either C# or Node.js*\n",
    "  - **QnA Auth Key**: *This should automatically be set to the authenbtication key for your QnA knowledge base*\n",
    "  - **App service plan/location**: *This should be set automatically to a suitable plan and location*\n",
    "  - **Application Insights**: Off\n",
    "  - **Microsoft App ID and password**: Auto create App ID and password.\n",
    "4. Wait for your bot to be created. The in the notification that deployment has completed, click **Go to resource** (or alternatively, on the home page, click **Resource groups*, open the resource group where you created the web app bot, and click it.)\n",
    "5. In the blade for your bot, view the **Test in Web Chat** page, and wait until the bot displays the message **Hello and welcome!**.\n",
    "6. Use the test chat interface to ensure your bot answers questions from your knowledge base as expected. For example, try asking `How can I contact you?`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access the Bot through a Channel\n",
    "\n",
    "A bot can be used to provide an interface for users through one or more *channels*. For example, the same bot could support interactions through a web chat interface, email, and Microsoft Teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Azure portal, in the blade for your bot, view the **Channels** page.\n",
    "2. Note that the **Web Chat** channel has been aded automatically, and that other channels for common communication platforms are available.\n",
    "3. Next to the **Web Chat** channel, click **Edit**. This opens a page with the settings you need to embed your bot in a web page. To embed your bot, you need the HTML embed code provided as well as one of the secret keys generated for your bot.\n",
    "4. Copy the **Embed code** and paste it into the cell below, replacing the comment `# EMBED CODE GOES HERE`.\n",
    "5. Click **Show** for one of your secret keys (it doesn't matter which one), and copy it. Then paste it in your HTML embed code below, replacing `YOUR_SECRET_HERE`.\n",
    "6. Change the **min-height** value in your HTML code to **200px** (instead of the default 400px). This will help ensure the HTML interface is visible without scrolling.\n",
    "7. Run the cell below by clicking its green green <span style=\"color:green\">&#9655</span> button (at the top left of the cell) to render the HTML. The in the HTML chat interface, test the bot by submitting a question (for example *How can I cancel a rental?*).\n"
