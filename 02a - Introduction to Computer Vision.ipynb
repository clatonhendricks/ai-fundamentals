        "*Computer Vision* is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that explores the development of AI systems that can \"see\" the world, either in real-time through a camera or by analyzing images and video. This is made possible by the fact that digital images are essentially just arrays of numeric pixel values, and we can use those pixel values as *features* to train machine learning models that can classify images, detect discrete objects in an image, and even generate text-based summaries of a photographs.\n",
