    "# Classification with Azure Machine Learning *designer*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, you used the automated machine learning feature of Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy a machine learning model for *regression*, in which you predicted a numeric value. In this lab, you'll create a model for *classification*, in which the model predicts the category, or *class*, a given entity belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "While automated machine learning makes it easy to try lots of algorithms and find the best performing model for your data, there may be cases where you want more control over how your data is prepared and used to train a model; so this time you'll use another Azure Machine Learning feature called *designer*, which enables you to define workflow for model training in a visual, drag and drop interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a form of supervised machine learning in which a model is trained to fit the *features* of an entity to a *label* that represents a particular class. The label is usually an integer indicator, such as 0, 1, or 2; with each indicator representing a different possible classification. As you might recall from the previous lab, we often think of a machine learning model as a function (***f***) that operates on features (**x**) to predict a label (**y**); and in this case, **y** is a numeric indicator for a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example to make things a little clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:center'><img src='./images/diabetes.jpg' alt=\"Clinical data for multiple patients, some of whom are diabetic and some of whom aren't\"/></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a health clinic offers patients a general health screening, where they can provide their personal details (age, number of children, and so on) and have some medical metrics measured (weight, blood pressure, and so on). The screening might also include a test for diabetes, for which some patients may test negative and others positive. So there's a sense in which there are two *classes* of patient; those with diabetes, and those without. We could assign numeric labels to those classes, with ***0*** meaning that the patient tested negative for diabetes, and ***1*** meaning a positive diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's suppose that the diabetes test is expensive to conduct, and stressful for the patient being tested (important tip: it's not, if you think you're at risk *please* go and get tested. We're just imagining it is for the purposes of this lab example!). The clinic might want to restrict testing to only those patients with a high probability of testing positive. So the challenge is to take all of the other information we have about the patients (age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) and try to find a correlation with the classification of the patient as non-diabetic or diabetic. In other words, we use the patient's medical measurements as *features* to predict a class *label* that indicates the likelihood of a positive diagnosis for diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A slight technicality (which will be important later!)**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Up to this point, we've throught of a classification model as predicting a numeric class indicator, like 0 or 1. Actually, it's a little more complicated than that. What the model actually calculates is the *probability* of the entity belonging to each possible label - so the result of the function (*f*) is actually a vector (in other words, an array of values) that contains a probability score for each possible class. For our diabetes example, the function might return a vector such as $[0.2, 0.8]$, which indicates that there's a 0.2 (20%) probability that this particular patient belongs to class 0 (non-diabetic), and 0.8 (80%) probability that they belong to class 1 (diabetic). We classify the entity based on the most probable label prediction, so in this case the patient would be classified as class 1 (diabetic).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Note that the individual class probabilities always add up to 1 - there's a 100% probability that the patient is either diabetic or non-diabetic!\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In this case, the model we're creating only has two possible classes - we call this *binary* classification. However, the same principles are true for scenarios where there are multiple possible classes. For example, we could create a model to predict non-diabetic, type A diabetes, and type B diabetes classes. This would result in a vector of three probability values (one for each possible class), which would still add up to 1."

    "\n",
    "To get started with Azure machine Learning designer, first you must create a pipeline and add the dataset you want to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) for your workspace, view the **Designer** page and create a new pipeline.\n",
    "2. In the **Settings** pane, change the default pipeline name (**Pipeline-Created-on-*date***) to **Visual Diabetes Training** (if the **Settings** pane is not visible, click the **&#9881;** icon next to the pipeline name at the top).\n",
    "3. Note that you need to specify a compute target on which to run the pipeline. In the **Settings** pane, click **Select compute target** and select the **aml-cluster** compute target you created in the previous lab.\n",
    "4. On the left side of the designer, expand the **Datasets** section, and drag the **diabetes dataset** dataset you created in the previous exercise onto the canvas.\n",
    "5. Select the **diabetes dataset** module on the canvas, and view its settings. Then on the **outputs** tab, click the **Visualize** icon (which looks like a column chart).\n",
    "6. Review the schema of the data, noting that you can see the distributions of the various columns as histograms. Then close the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Add Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can train a model, you typically need to apply some preprocessing transformations to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the pane on the left, expand the **Data Transformation** section, which contains a wide range of modules you can use to transform data and pre-process it before model training. Drag a **Normalize Data** module to the canvas, below the **diabetes dataset** module. Then connect the output from the **diabetes dataset** module to the input of the **Normalize Data** module.\n",
    "2. Select the **Normalize Data** module and view its settings, noting that it requires you to specify the transformation method and the columns to be transformed. Then, leaving the transformation as **ZScore**, edit the columns to includes the following column names:\n",
    "    * PlasmaGlucose\n",
    "    * DiastolicBloodPressure\n",
    "    * TricepsThickness\n",
    "    * SerumInsulin\n",

    "    * DiabetesPedigree\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Note**: We're normalizing the numeric columns put them on the same scale, and avoid columns with large values doiminating model training. You'd normally apply a whole bunch of pre-processing transformations like this to prepare your data for training, but we'll keep things simple in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now we're ready to split the data into separate datasets for training and validation. In the pane on the left, in the **Data Transformations** section, drag a **Split Data** module onto the canvas under the **Normalize Data** module. Then connect the *Transformed Dataset* (left) output of the **Normalize Data** module to the input of the **Split Data** module.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Add Model Training Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data prepared and split into training and validation datasets, you're ready to configure the pipeline to train and evaluate a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expand the **Model Training** section in the pane on the left, and drag a **Train Model** module to the canvas, under the **Split Data** module. Then connect the *Result dataset1* (left) output of the **Split Data** module to the *Dataset* (right) input of the **Train Model** module.\n",
    "2. The model we're training will predict the **Diabetic** value, so select the **Train Model** module and modify its settings to set the **Label column** to  **Diabetic** (matching the case and spelling exactly!)\n",
    "3. The **Diabetic** label the model will predict is a binary column (1 for patients who have diabetes, 0 for patients who don't), so we need to train the model using a *classification* algorithm. Expand the **Machine Learning Algorithms** section, and under **Classification**, drag a **Two-Class Logistic Regression** module to the canvas, to the left of the **Split Data** module and above the **Train Model** module. Then connect its output to the **Untrained model** (left) input of the **Train Model** module.\n",
    "4. To test the trained model, we need to use it to score the validation dataset we held back when we split the original data. Expand the **Model Scoring & Evaluation** section and drag a **Score Model** module to the canvas, below the **Train Model** module. Then connect the output of the **Train Model** module to the **Trained model** (left) input of the **Score Model** module; and drag the **Results dataset2** (right) output of the **Split Data** module to the **Dataset** (right) input of the **Score Model** module.\n",
    "5. To evaluate how well the model performs, we need to look at some metrics generated by scoring the validation dataset. From the **Model Scoring & Evaluation** section, drag an **Evaluate Model** module to the canvas, under the **Score Model** module, and connect the output of the **Score Model** module to the **Score dataset** (left) input of the **Evaluate Model** module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run the Training Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data flow steps defined, you're now ready to run the training pipeline and train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify that your pipeline looks similar to the following (note that the image includes comments in each module to document what they're doing - it's not a bad idea to do this when you're using the Designer for a real project!):\n",

    "\n",
    "2. At the top right, click **Run**. Then when prompted, create a new *experiment* named **visual-training**, and run it.  This will initialize the compute target and then run the pipeline, which may take 10 minutes or longer. You  can see the status of the pipeline run above the top right of the design canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Tip**: While it's running, you can view the pipeline and experiment that have been created in the **Pipelines** and **Experiments** pages. Switch back to the **Visual Diabetes Training** pipeline on the **Designer** page when you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the **Normalize Data** module has finished (indicated by a &#x2705; icon), select it, and in the **Settings** pane, on the **Outputs + Logs** tab, under **Port outputs** in the **Transformed dataset** section, click the **Visualize** icon, and note that you can view statistics and distribution visualizations for the transformed columns.\n",
    "4. Close the **Normalize Data** visualizations, close or resize the settings pane (click the X or **<sub>&#8599;</sub><sup>&#8601;</sup>** icon), and wait for the rest of the modules to complete. Then visualize the output of the **Evaluate Model** module to see the performance metrics for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Note**: The performance of this model isn't all that great, partly because we performed only minimal feature engineering and pre-processing. You could try some different classification algorithms and compare the results (you can connect the outputs of the **Split Data** module to multiple **Train Model** and **Score Model** modules, and you can connect a second scored model to the **Evaluate Model** module to see a side-by-side comparison). The point of the exercise is simply to introduce you to the Designer interface, not to train a perfect model!"
